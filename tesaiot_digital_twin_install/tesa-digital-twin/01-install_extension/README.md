# Install the **TESA Digital Twin** Extension

The **TESA Digital Twin** extension brings powerful 3D simulation capabilities directly to your development environment. This tutorial will guide you through installing the extension in Visual Studio Code (or any VS Code-based IDE).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Visual Studio Code or another VS Code-based IDE installed on your system.

## Method 1: Install from Marketplace

This is the recommended method for most users. The extension is available directly from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.

1. **Open the Extensions View**: Launch VS Code and click the **Extensions** icon in the Activity Bar on the left side (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).

2. **Search for the Extension**: In the Extensions search bar, type `TERNION Digital Twin` and wait for the search results to appear.

3. **Install the Extension**: Click the **Install** button on the **TERNION Digital Twin** extension card.

## Method 2: Install from VSIX File

If you have a `.vsix` file (for example, `ternion-digital-twin-1.0.0.vsix` or any other version), you can install the extension directly from the file. This method is useful when you have a specific version or when installing from a local build.

1. **Open the Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the command palette.

2. **Search for VSIX Install Command**: Type `VSIX` in the command palette and select **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** from the dropdown list.

3. **Select the Extension File**: Navigate to and select your `.vsix` file (e.g., `ternion-digital-twin-1.0.0.vsix`), then click the **Install** button.

## Verification

Once the installation is complete, you should see the extension listed in your installed extensions. The extension will be automatically enabled and ready to use in your VS Code workspace. You can verify the installation by checking for the **TESA Digital Twin** icon button in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.
